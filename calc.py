#create calculator.py file in this file define four user defined functions for airthematic operations such as add,subtract,multiply and 
#devide each function should take 2 parameters and return the result.
#create main.py file and import the calculator.py file and read two numbers and perform airthematic operations using userdefined 
#functions and display the result.

#define four functions for airthematic operation
#function for addition
def add(x,y):
    result=x+y
    return result

#function for substraction
def sub(x,y):
    result=x-y
    return result

#function for multification
def mul(x,y):
    result=x*y
    return result

#function for devision
def div(x,y):
    result=x/y
    return result
